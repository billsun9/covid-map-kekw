The most common way the virus spreads is by unseen droplets in the air when an infected person breathes out. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people nearby or possibly inhaled into the lungs. The droplets land on surfaces, which we then touch, so frequent hand washing or use of an alcohol-based hand sanitizer is advised.</p>

                    <p><b>Protect your household.</b><br> If anyone in your household is at higher risk for severe illness from the virus, all members of the household should behave as if they share the same risk factors to avoid introducing the virus into the home. You should think of your entire household as a single unit. If one person puts themselves at risk, everyone in the home is at risk. That means you should strictly adhere to the CDC's isolation and quarantine guidelines.</p>

      <p>Stay at least 6 feet apart. Avoid public spaces where close contact with others may occur. The most common way the virus spreads is by unseen droplets in the air when an infected person breathes out. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people nearby or possibly inhaled into the lungs. The droplets land on surfaces, which we then touch, so frequent hand washing or use of an alcohol-based hand sanitizer is advised.</p>
